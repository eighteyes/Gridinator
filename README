Gridinator is a WordPress plugin to display and edit heirarchically organized information nodes within a WordPress page.

It is highly customized for a particular utility, and does not have any administrative or customizable features. Data is modified through inline editing when a logged in user accesses the page.

Currently included is:
• Title Field - Displayed on Main Page
• Lightbox popup for the details on each node.
• Two paragraph fields, one of which sorts and builds links.
• Two image uploads, each with description and tagline field.

You will have to tinker with this to get it to work for your purposes, but if you're looking to build something similiar, I'm sure it will be a useful starting point.
